        Our Story
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-3">
        Founded by a team of passionate travelers, trekkers, and nature
        enthusiasts, YatraSathi was created with one simple mission: to make
        adventure travel more accessible, safe, and enriching for everyone. We
        understand that every journey is a personal story, and we want to be
        part of yours. What started as a small group of avid trekkers has now
        blossomed into a trusted network of local guides, adventure experts, and
        travelers from around the world. We’ve partnered with local communities
        to create authentic, culturally immersive trips that provide lasting
        memories and contribute positively to the places we visit.
